# 3D printed parts

You should print all the files once except Mount part (2 pieces) and cable cover (as much as you need to route the cable to the other side).

## Part orientation
Mount, electronics cover and bearing holder should be printed on the side or facing up, this way layers won't break due to weight.

**You will need supports**
